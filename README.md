# Python RecursionError Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the `RecursionError`. The `factorial.py` file contains a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.  When called with a negative number, it results in an infinite recursion, leading to the `RecursionError`. The solution shows how to handle this by adding a check for invalid input.
